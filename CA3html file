    <!-- Pollution Types -->
    <section id="pollution-types">
        <div class="div1">
            <h3>Air Pollution</h3>
            <p>Air pollution occurs when harmful substances like carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides are released into the atmosphere. These pollutants come from vehicle emissions, industrial processes, burning fossil fuels, and other sources. Long-term exposure to polluted air can lead to respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular diseases, and even impact the nervous system.</p>
            <p>Efforts to reduce air pollution include adopting cleaner fuels, improving public transportation, using renewable energy sources, and implementing stricter emission regulations. Each of us can contribute by reducing car usage, conserving energy, and supporting eco-friendly practices.</p>

        <div class="div2">
            <h3>Water Pollution</h3>
            <p>Water pollution is caused by contaminants such as chemicals, plastics, and waste entering rivers, lakes, and oceans. These pollutants come from agricultural runoff, industrial waste, untreated sewage, and plastic disposal, endangering aquatic life and impacting human health when the contaminated water is used.</p>
            <p>Preventing water pollution involves proper waste disposal, reducing plastic usage, and supporting water treatment systems. Educating communities on the dangers of dumping waste and using eco-friendly products are effective steps towards cleaner water bodies.</p>

        <div class="div3">
            <h3>Soil Pollution</h3>
            <p>Soil pollution results from the introduction of harmful chemicals and waste into the ground. These pollutants, including pesticides, heavy metals, and industrial waste, degrade the quality of soil, affecting crop health and biodiversity. Soil pollution can lead to reduced agricultural productivity and harm local ecosystems.</p>
            <p>Controlling soil pollution involves reducing the use of harmful pesticides, managing industrial waste, recycling, and promoting sustainable agricultural practices. By using organic farming methods and waste reduction, we can help preserve our soil quality.</p>

        <div class="div4">
            <h3>Noise Pollution</h3>
            <p>Noise pollution is the excessive and disturbing noise from sources like traffic, construction sites, and industrial activities. Prolonged exposure to high noise levels can lead to hearing loss, stress, sleep disturbances, and other health issues.</p>
            <p>To reduce noise pollution, sound barriers, and green buffers around noisy areas, using quieter machinery, and enforcing noise regulations in residential areas are effective. Individuals can contribute by keeping noise levels down, particularly in densely populated areas.</p>
